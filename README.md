## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a third-year Computer Systems Engineering student passionate about mobile app development.  
I specialize in building cross-platform apps using **Flutter**, with a strong focus on **Firebase integration**, **GetX state management**, and clean, maintainable code using **Simple Clean Architecture**.

I enjoy creating practical apps that solve real problems and bring smooth user experiences to life.
